A simple way to run **Codex powered by `deepseek-flash`** on Windows and macOS without installing heavy developer toolchains or building Node.js environments is through the **ChatGPT Desktop App** using DeepSeek's automated setup script. On Linux, the same DeepSeek configuration can be used in a graphical user interface with the **Codex IDE extension for VS Code**; the official ChatGPT Desktop App is currently available on Windows and macOS, not Linux.

Codex shares its backend system configuration (`~/.codex/config.toml`) across all clients. On Windows, this file is under your user profile (for example, `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml`); on macOS/Linux, it is `~/.codex/config.toml`. Setting it up once instantly makes **DeepSeek-Flash** available across supported Codex clients.

### Prerequisites (1 Minute Setup)

1. **Get a DeepSeek API Key:** 
   - We provide each student a private API key with some free quota to use DeepSeek-Flash for assignments. We will send you the key via email.
   - If you want to use additional quota, log in to [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com), purchase additional quota, and copy an API key starting with `sk-`.
2. **Install and launch a Codex client once:** This allows Codex to generate its configuration folder (`.codex`).
   - **Windows:** Install and launch the official **ChatGPT Desktop App**, which includes Codex.
   - **macOS:** Install and launch the official **ChatGPT Desktop App**, which includes Codex.
   - **Linux:** Install and launch the **Codex IDE extension for VS Code** once. The official ChatGPT Desktop App is not currently available for Linux.

1. **Run the 1-Line Setup:** Executes DeepSeek's official automated configuration.

   **Windows**

   1. Open **PowerShell** on your Windows PC (Press `Win + X` and select **PowerShell** or **Terminal**).
   2. Paste and run DeepSeek's official PowerShell configuration command with the API endpoint replaced to point to our relay server:

   ```powershell
   (irm https://cdn.deepseek.com/api-docs/codex-deepseek-setup-en.ps1).Replace('https://api.deepseek.com/', 'http://sccpu6.cse.ust.hk/v1/') | iex
   ```

   **macOS / Linux**

   1. Open **Terminal**.
   2. Paste and run DeepSeek's official shell configuration command with the API endpoint replaced to point to our relay server:

   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://cdn.deepseek.com/api-docs/codex-deepseek-setup-en.sh | sed 's|https://api\.deepseek\.com/|http://sccpu6.cse.ust.hk/v1/|g')
   ```

   **Note:** 
   1. The relay server `http://sccpu6.cse.ust.hk/v1/` is only accessible within the campus network of HKUST. If you are off-campus, please use the [HKUST VPN](https://itso.hkust.edu.hk/services/cyber-security/vpn/client-installation) to connect to the campus network before using Codex connected to our relay server.
   2. When your quota given by us is used up and you want to use your own DeepSeek API official key, please run the original DeepSeek setup script **without the relay server replacement** two times to remove the relay server configuration and set your own DeepSeek API key, respectively. The original DeepSeek setup script is:
   ```powershell
   irm https://cdn.deepseek.com/api-docs/codex-deepseek-setup-en.ps1 | iex
   ```
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://cdn.deepseek.com/api-docs/codex-deepseek-setup-en.sh)
   ```

2. **Configure the Model Provider:** Select DeepSeek-Flash and enter API credential.

   1. When prompted by the script, paste your **DeepSeek API Key** (`sk-...`).
   2. Select **Option 1** (`deepseek-flash`).
   3. The script will automatically write the necessary `models.json` metadata and register `[model_providers.deepseek]` in your system configuration.
3. **Launch the App / Client:** Start using Codex with DeepSeek-Flash.

   **Windows**

   1. Open the **ChatGPT Desktop / Codex** application.
   2. Under the model selection dropdown, the model may appear as **`DeepSeek-Flash`** or **`Custom`**. When `Custom` is shown after this configuration, Codex is using the DeepSeek model selected by the setup script.
   3. Open any workspace directory or project folder and start prompting your agent.

   **macOS**

   1. Open the **ChatGPT Desktop / Codex** application.
   2. Under the model selection dropdown, the configured DeepSeek model is typically shown as **`Custom`**.
   3. Open any workspace directory or project folder and start prompting your agent.

   **Linux**

   1. Open the project in **VS Code** and use the **Codex IDE extension**; it reads the same `~/.codex/config.toml` configuration.
      If the startup banner shows `model: deepseek-flash`, the configuration is active.

### Advantages

* **Zero per-client model configuration:** You configure DeepSeek once in the shared Codex configuration instead of setting up each Codex client separately.
* **No local Node.js build environment required for the DeepSeek configuration:** The automated setup script writes the required Codex configuration directly.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** You interact with the agent through the ChatGPT Desktop App (Windows & macOS) and the Codex VS Code extension (Linux) with workspace and visual diff support.
